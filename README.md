## Overview

This narrative visualization tells the complete story of the COVID-19 pandemic through four focused scenes:

1. **Scene 1: The Outbreak** - The early days of COVID-19 and its initial global spread
2. **Scene 2: The Surge** - The devastating peak of the pandemic and its global impact  
3. **Scene 3: The Recovery** - The path to recovery and lessons learned from the pandemic
4. **Scene 4: Country Comparison** - Compare how different countries were affected by the pandemic across the entire timeline

## Narrative Structure

This visualization follows an **Interactive Slideshow** structure, where users can explore different aspects of the pandemic story while maintaining a guided narrative flow. Each scene focuses on a specific time period and aspect of the pandemic, allowing users to understand the progression from outbreak to recovery while providing opportunities for detailed exploration.

## Assignment Compliance

### Required Elements:
- ‚úÖ **Scenes**: Four carefully ordered scenes with consistent visual templates
- ‚úÖ **Annotations**: Consistent annotation template with scene-specific highlighting
- ‚úÖ **Parameters**: Clear state management with documented parameters
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: Multiple user interaction triggers with appropriate affordances

### Narrative Structure:
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Slideshow**: Guided progression with exploration opportunities
- ‚úÖ **D3.js Implementation**: Pure D3.js with d3-annotation library
- ‚úÖ **No High-Level Tools**: No Tableau, Vega, or other restricted libraries

## Features

- **Four focused scenes** that tell a complete pandemic story
- **Consistent annotation system** with scene-specific highlighting
- **Interactive elements** with hover tooltips for detailed data exploration
- **Country-level data** with comparison capabilities
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Keyboard navigation** using arrow keys and escape key
- **Smooth transitions** between scenes with consistent visual language
- **Dynamic user guidance** that changes based on current scene
- **Aligned x-axis scales** across all scenes for better temporal understanding

## Data Source

The visualization uses data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) COVID-19 dataset, which provides daily global confirmed cases and deaths, as well as country-level data for the top 10 affected countries.

## Technical Implementation

- **D3.js v7** for data visualization
- **d3-annotation** for milestone annotations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for narrative logic and state management
- **CSS3** for styling and animations
- **HTML5** for structure

## Data Processing

The `data.py` script downloads and processes the JHU COVID-19 data:
- Downloads confirmed cases and deaths data from JHU CSSE GitHub repository
- Aggregates global totals by date
- Processes country-level data for top 10 countries
- Exports processed data as JSON for use in the visualization

## Narrative Elements

### Scenes
Each scene follows a consistent template while using different chart types:

- **Outbreak**: Line chart with milestone annotations (early 2020)
- **Surge**: Area chart highlighting the peak period (March-July 2020)
- **Recovery**: Dual-line chart showing cases and deaths (2021-2023)
- **Countries**: Multi-line chart comparing all 10 countries across the full timeline (2020-2023)

### Annotations
Consistent annotation template with scene-specific content:
- **Visual Template**: Dashed line, colored background, title and description
- **Scene 1**: WHO emergency and pandemic declarations
- **Scene 2**: Global peak identification
- **Scene 3**: Vaccination milestone
- **Scene 4**: Interactive tooltips for country exploration

### Parameters
Key state parameters that control the visualization:
- `currentScene` (0-3): Current scene index
- `selectedCountry` (string/null): Highlighted country
- `highlightedDataPoint` (object/null): Highlighted data point
- `animationSpeed` (500ms): Transition duration
- `dataFilter` (string): Data subset filter

### Triggers
User interactions that update parameters:
- **Navigation**: Button clicks, keyboard arrows
- **Exploration**: Mouse hover, mouse out
- **Clear**: Escape key for clearing highlights

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color scheme
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Print-friendly styles
